## Contest

Ok! Now you have all the code you need to update the webpage in this gist. Optimize all you can, and test with Website Speed Test and WebPage Test.

When you are completed, you can submit your results into this form:

## [Submit Your Site!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYhsJWpZGrzrg76MmSzkKxSlyfvblDX9_SmaKi7Q39R0FLTw/viewform)

To run the required tests, your site must be hosted and accessible from the internet. You can use GitHub Pages. 

1. Visit pages.github.com 

2. set up a repository named .github.io

 3. once this is created, you are given the option to import from another repository. Enter:"[https://github.com/dougsillars/dougsillars.github.io](https://github.com/dougsillars/dougsillars.github.io)", and you've essentially cloned this repository into your own GitHub Pages repository.
