#Tools
To speed up this webpage, we need to load everything faster.  Simply put, these images need to get smaller, so they download faster. To benchmark these tests, we'll use 2 tools:

1. <a href="https://webspeedtest.cloudinary.com" target = "_blank">Website Speed Test</a> to test the performance of the images on the page.
2. <a href="https://webpagetest.org" target="_blank">WebPageTest</a> to measure the load time of the page.

>Note: These two tools are synced, if you run a WebPageTest run, you can access the Website Speed Test results from the "Image Analysis" link at the top of the page.


Here are links to the initial results (unoptimized):

The initial page scores "mediocre" in WebSite Speed Test, but we can see that the page has 10MB of images, and Cloudinary can reduce the files to 732 KB - a data savings of 92%!

Shows that the load time was 19.6s, and the SpeedIndex (a measurement of speed to paint the screen was 7258.

So, what steps can we take to make this page faster?  As I discussed in my Lunch and Learn, there are several steps we can take. So, clone this page and begin Optimizing!


We would like to take these images, and modify them to get the page to load faster. To benchmark these tests, we'll use 2 tools:

<ul>
<li>[Website Speed Test](https://webspeedtest.cloudinary.com/) to test the performance of the images on the page.</li>
<li>[WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/) to measure the load time of the page.</li>
<ul>
> NOTE: that these two tools are synced, if you run a WebPageTest run, you can access the Website Speed Test results from the "Image Analysis" link at the top of the page.
