# Optimize Media for Fast Page Loading:

## Fast and Beautiful Images

Building fast and beautiful images for apps the the web.

According to the HTTPArchive, &gt;50% of all data on mobile websites are images, and the number of KB is grew by 5% year over year \(March, 2017- March 2018\).

Research shows that webpages and apps that are slow to load frustrate users.

# Speeding up A Slow Website: Optimizing Images

In this exercise, we will use [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com), a cloud based image delivery service, to optimize a simple webpage and improve its load time while still serving beautiful images that will delight everyone who visits.

index.html is a pretend "summer vacation blog post" with 15 images. The images were just uploaded straight from Google Photos, and as a result, the page weighs over 10 MB. The first load of the page \(when the images are not cached\) is extremely slow.[Try it!](https://dougsillars.github.io/)\(See what I mean?\)
